## Project Overview
ProSizeNet introduces a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture for predicting protein residue sizes. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the sequential learning power of Transformers, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in protein structure prediction tasks. The architecture uniquely leverages multi-branch processing with attention mechanisms to capture both local and global protein characteristics.

## Key Features
- Multi-branch hybrid architecture combining CNN and Transformer capabilities
- Attention-enhanced feature processing for improved prediction accuracy
- Comprehensive comparison of multiple deep learning approaches
- Robust validation using multiple performance metrics
- Detailed analysis of model behavior across different protein structures


### Innovative Components
- **Dual CNN Pathways**:
  - Narrow-Deep Branch: 128→64 filters for detailed feature extraction
  - Wide-Shallow Branch: 256 filters for broader pattern recognition

- **Dense Processing Streams**:
  - Deep Stream: 256→128→64 units with LayerNormalization
  - Wide Stream: 512→256 units with BatchNormalization

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Custom attention blocks for feature importance weighting
  - Residual connections for enhanced gradient flow
  - Hybrid activation approach (LeakyReLU + PReLU)
  - Sophisticated regularization strategy
